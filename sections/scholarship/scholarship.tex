Whittier College faculty classify scholarship using the \textit{Boyer} model \cite{boyer}.  My scholarship primarily falls within two categories: the scholarship of discovery, and the scholarship of application.  I utilize physics education research (PER) in my teaching practices.  When I tried my hand at advising a Whittier Scholars Program major, I found myself performing the scholarship of integration (see Sec. \ref{sec:advising_mentoring}).  In the following sections I reflect upon my scholarly work, and share my vision for the future.  In Sec. \ref{sec:professional}, I describe my research field, giving it proper historical context.  In Sec. \ref{sec:invite}, I share exciting news regarding my research and Whittier College.  In Sec. \ref{sec:neutrino}, I organize my scholarship of discovery into five categories and list progress made by my students and I.  I also draw a connection to my teaching and advising practices in each category, since they are interconnected.  In Sec. \ref{sec:naval_research}, I describe my new venture into the scholarship of application.  This has been a fruitful partnership with the Office of Naval Research (ONR).  Finally, in Sec. \ref{sec:naval_collaboration}, I propose an idea that for a partnership program has been shared with me by my colleagues at the ONR.
