The introductory STEM courses I have taught thus far at Whittier College are now introduced, with connections to departmental goals and learning focuses listed in Sec. \ref{sec:methods}.

\textbf{\textit{Algebra-based physics (135A/B)}}. Algebra-based physics, PHYS135A/B, is a two-semester integrated lecture/laboratory sequence covering Newton's Laws to electromagnetism\footnote{See supplemental material for example syllabi.}.  PHYS135 is a requirement for majors such as KNS and CHEM.  Students practice problem-solving with algebra, trigonometry, and vectors.  I employ a mixture of TT and PER methods to satisfy \textbf{departmental goals 1, 4, and 6}.  I have modified the balance of TT and PER in alignment with department and FPC recommendations.

The first learning focus for non-majors is \textbf{curiosity}, with the measureable goals stated in Sec. \ref{sec:methods}.  To satisfy the goal of increasing curiosity, students may present at the outset of class a recent science journal article pertaining to physics.  I incentivise this with extra credit, and I help them to practice oral communication of scientific ideas (\textbf{Departmental goal 7}).  Once the students overcome nerves and try speaking in front of peers, they begin to choose content connected to their major.  It is wonderful to see the students teach their peers.

A second method is to require the students to design a final project in small groups.  The OpenStax textbooks contain many workable examples.  Each group must first submit a proposal in the middle of the semester.  I then help them refine it and ensure they have proper equipment.  After data collection, the students practice presenting in office hours.  The students design, build, and execute their projects, which gives them an avenue for their physics curiosity.  Making this assignment an oral presentation also goes toward \textbf{Departmental goal 7}.  Course evaluation data show that the students \textit{report an increase in their curiosity for physics}.

The second introductory focus is \textbf{improvement of analysis skill}.  I utilize PI modules and PhET simulations strategically.  PI (Peer Instruction) modules were first developed by Eric Mazur \cite{mazur2013peer}, and have better measured performance than TT only courses.  Physics concepts can be illustrated with PhET (Physics Education Technology) simulations, or used to perform laboratory activities we cannot consruct (e.g. altering the strength of gravity)\cite{phet}.  These two modules are my main PER tools for boosting student problem-solving.  Finally, I learned to use JITT modules \cite{jitt} at a workshop for new physics professors given by the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) in 2017.  The students shared in 2017-2018 that they prefer step-by-step examples to JITT.

PER shows that students learn efficiently from peers explaining their reasoning.  Table discussions encourage this type of learning and give me the chance to help the struggling students.  Spending time with struggling students helps me build a relationship of trust, which alleviates some anxiety.  After short table discussions, students submit their answers again.  We observe the answer distribution shift toward the correct one (see Fig. \ref{fig:exampleData}).  Further, if 70\% of students answer correctly, we move forward.  Thus, we accelerate the pace if the students understand.  This creates the possibility of a few students being left behind, so I have added the concept of WAT\footnote{e.g. ``What?'' A meme indicating confusion.}.  WAT corresponds to answer E.  If I observe a WAT, I revert to a TT example.  \textit{This strategy ensures inclusivity}, in that we strive to leave no one behind in class.

The second-half of the lecture/laboratory format is the lab activity or PhET module.  An example of the interplay between labs and PhET occurs in PHYS135B and PHYS180 (electromagnetism).  The students build DC electric circuits.  If the circuit is constructable in our lab, they complete an LA module to measure voltages and electric current to verify Ohm's Law\footnote{Ohm's law states that the current observed is proportional to the voltage in the circuit.}.  If the circuit cannot be easily built in our lab, we simulate it virtually with PhET software.  Whenever possible, we first simulate the circuit in PhET, and then physically construct it to compare simulation and experiment.  The PI modules, PhET modules, and traditional lecture content form a flexible and diverse strategy for improving the students' analysis skill (\textbf{Departmental goals 1, 4, and 6}).
\\

My third introductory course learning focus is \textbf{applications to society}.  The obvious routes are the applications in the OpenStax texts \cite{openstax1} regarding kinesiology and medicine.  The students experience PI modules and example problems with topics such as motion/work/energy in the human body, nerve cells as DC circuit simulation, and lightning/weather.  Which modules I select depends on the students' majors.  Learning what interests the students and including content specifically pertaining to their majors is highly beneficial to keep students engaged.  Dropping the JITT module also frees more class-preparation time to add material I know particular students will enjoy\footnote{See supplemental material for an example of such a unit.}.
\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
Two final methods for my third learning focus are article discussions and term-papers.  Of the ways my students reach the third learning focus, these were the least used during remote instruction.  Article discussions involve a student selecting an online article to present to the class before the TT module for extra credit on homework.  Students practice oral communication of technical ideas, and summarizing quickly in front of a group.  Occasionally, I suggest high-impact articles and offer extra credit on the midterm, which causes a flood of volunteers.  Some brilliant term-papers have also emerged, including the history of the first measurement of the distance to the Sun\footnote{Included in the supplemental material.}.  The story of these first measurements is connected to the first explorations of Antarctica, and I included the astronomy/Antarctica connection in INTD255 (the Antarctica course).  Students opt to create term-papers more rarely, but it does provide them a venue to practice technical writing (\textbf{Departmental goal 7}).
