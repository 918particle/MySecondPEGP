In Fall 2021, I taught my first section of INTD100: College Writing Seminar.  Of all the courses I have taught, this one was the most different from my field of expertise.  I imagine describing my course objectives and activities for my section of INTD100 will sound wrong or different to a professional writing or English instructor.  To better conform with what has been done in the past in INTD100, I met with Charles Eastman during Summer 2020.  Charlie gave me helpful advice regarding the recommended length of assignments, and how to assess writing.  THe theme of the course was scientific and technical writing, with emphasis on clarity, conciseness, passive voice, and the use of carefully planned structure for larger tracts of writing.

Although the theme of the course was centered around scientific and technical writing, we began with summer reading from \textit{Notes of a Native Son} by James Baldwin.  Given the events of Summer 2020, I felt that I had to incorporate \textit{something} that spoke to the need for social justice and reform.  My family watched \textit{I Am Not Your Negro}, directed by Raoul Peck, which focused on Balwin's writings about the history of racism and the civil rights movement.  I decided to actually read the book, and Balwin's descriptions of the ghettos around New York City, and Harlem in particular, resonated with me.  The reason has to do with where we live, and how some of my students have been my neighbors.  I asked my advisees (who were also my students in INTD100) to get the book and read a particular essay about the author growing up in Harlem.  I asked them to do five things: 1) practice summarizing the events of the essay in 120 words, 2) again, but using only 20 words, 3) to discuss an extended metaphor the author uses to describe the gut feeling of experiencing poverty in a crowded city, 4) to analyze the use of tangible evidence regarding a riot that took place in Harlem, and finally 5) a bonus assignment to draw links between the first chapter and a different chapter about the author's experience working for newspapers in Harlem.
