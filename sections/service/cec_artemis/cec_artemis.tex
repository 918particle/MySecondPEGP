In Sec. \ref{sec:cec}, I wrote about my experiences serving the Artemis program.  To avoid covering the same ground twice, I give just a simple summary of the facts here.  I have served the Artemis program twice in the past, and will volunteer in the future as soon as I am able.  In 2018-2019, we accepted applications for the Artemis program.  I volunteered to teach a group of three young women from local high-schools.  We created a Python3-based project involving physics education research (PER).  The young ladies used the code to collect data from their classmates and presented the results at URSCA 2019.  In 2019-2020, we again accepted applications for the Artemis program.  I volunteered to teach a group of four young women from local high-schools.  We designed a wearable Arduino microcontroller project to interface with WiFi in order to track down a lost family member.  Following examples we created, the young ladies learned to re-program the firmware of their boards and connect to WiFi.  We were beginning the phase of creating the wearable devices from the boards when the pandemic forced us to pause.  We will return to this project the next time I serve the program.
