Hello!
The main.pdf file is the PEGP report PDF.  All supporting 
materials are in the supporting_materials folder. The 
sections folder contains all the sub-directories with the
report sub-sections.  Although these should not be necessary to
read, they are there as backup.  They are also necessary for 
compiling the report with PDFLaTeX.  Finally, the 
bibliography.bib file is only necessary for compilation.
The text of the bibliography is at the end of main.pdf.
Thanks for your hard work this semester!
